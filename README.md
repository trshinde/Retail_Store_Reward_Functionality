# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

I have created a dummy data.json file and hard coded 10 customers for the retail store reward Point functionality. For each customer, created an price array of 3 months with 30 days hard coded values. 

Calculated each month transaction amount and each month reward point for each customer.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Use instruction: npm start
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
